[00:08.69] I know I shouldn't think this way about you
[00:11.12] But you got something
[00:12.63] It's like the world stops when I'm around you
[00:15.08] I'ma tell you one thing
[00:16.45] That I don't wanna put no pressure on you
[00:20.44] But I wanna take you home

[00:25.99] And we shouldn't but we know we want to
[00:28.52] I let you when me touch
[00:29.98] And I know you feel it too
[00:42.98]

[01:12.57] Who's gonna be the one to make the first move
[01:15.01] 'Cause that's my motive
[01:16.55] Am I being too obvious around you?
[01:19.05] Only if you notice
