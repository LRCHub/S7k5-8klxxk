The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be,
never be, never be
I know I shouldn’t think this
way about you
But you got something
It’s like the world stops
when I’m around you
I’ma tell you one thing
That I don’t wanna put
no pressure on ya
But I wanna take you home
I know we talk too much
when we shouldn’t
But we know we want to
Electric when we touch and
I know you feel it too
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
I’m waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout you
Waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout
(The love that could
never be us)
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
I’m waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout you
Waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout
(The love that could
never be us)
Who’s gonna be the one
to make the first move?
‘Cause that’s my motive
Am I being too obvious
around you?
Wonder if they’ve noticed
That I don’t wanna give
the wrong impression
But I wanna take you home
I know we talk too much
when we shouldn’t
But we know we want to
Electric when we touch and
I know you feel it too
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
I’m waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout you
Waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout
(The love that could
never be us)
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
I’m waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout you
Waking up, waking up,
waking up, thinking ’bout
(The love that could
never be us)
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
I’ve been thinking ’bout
waking up next to you
I’ve been thinking ’bout
the love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
The love that could never be us
